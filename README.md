# SA Crime Data Analysis

## Project Overview

Welcome to our honours assignment on crime data analysis. This assignment was completed by myself and two other honours students. This repo aims to show my experience with R, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning and data visualisation. This assignment involved using South African crime data to extract meaningful information, explore the ways patterns could be discovered and potentially predicted, and finally present the findings in a clear, intuitive manner. This was achieved through collaboration and various analytical techniques. This assignment was initially completed in RStudio using a Quarto notebook.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following important files and folders:

-   **data/:** Directory containing raw data files used in the analysis.
-   **Assignment2.Rproj:** RStudio project file for the assignment.
-   **FinalReport.pdf:** PDF version of the final report detailing our findings, methodologies and the insights gained through analysis.
-   **FinalReportWithCode.pdf:** PDF version of the report that includes the code chunks.
-   **codeNotebook.qmd:** Quarto markdown file containing the code and documentation for the project.
-   **hons_da_2024_assignment_2.pdf:** Project brief outlining the assignment requirements.

## Project Description

This project involves several key steps:

-   **Data Sourcing:** Finding useful data that could be used for meaningful analysis.
-   **Data Handling:** Reading and exploring the data. Cleaning through handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring data consistency.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Performing exploratory analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the crime data.
-   **Machine Learning:** Applying different types of machine learning algorithms for different tasks. This assignment makes use of linear regression, *k*-means clustering, and random forest classification.
-   **Data Visualisation:** Displaying the results of the EDA as well as the machine learning algorithms.
-   **Report Writing:** Interpreting the code and graphs. Presenting our findings in a meaningful, easy to understand manner.

## Usage

This repository is for viewing purposes only. If you are interested in the details of the analysis or the visualizations created, please explore the following files:

-   **hons_da_assignment_2_brief.pdf:** View the brief pdf for a detailed understanding of what the project entailed and the expected outcomes.
-  **FinalReport.pdf:** View the PDF report for the full discussion and presentation of the findings.
- **FinalReportWithCode.pdf:** View the PDF with the code to understand how the findings were reached.
- **codeNotebook.qmd:** Review the Quarto markdown file for the code and detailed documentation.

As mentioned, this assignment was completed using RStudio and the qmd notebook is best viewed through such a program.

### Notes on this repo

This assignment was uploaded as a representation of my EDA and machine learning skills in R at the time. All data sources used are publicly available and cited within the notebook and the pdf report.

This assignment was completed on 10 May 2024 as part of the Stellenbosch University Bachelor of Informatics Honours program, by myself and two classmates.
